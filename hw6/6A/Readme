This assignment was written by Aaron Hong (ahong02). After testing, the results show a couple things. Firstly, the total CPU time taken increases across tests roughly linearly with the number of trials. Within each individual test, the average bytes per block stays about the same and the amount of free blocks increases across trials. All of these observations align with the expected behavior, showing that the bench is working properly. While writing this assignment, stack overflow and online C documentation were indispensable resources.
